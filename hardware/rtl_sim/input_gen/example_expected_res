# IN_PKT:	0x00000064

You should expect the above counter values when running the m10_100.pcap.
m10_100.pcap contains 100 packets, 10 of them would trigger MSPM match. 

IN_PKT is number of the input packets of the system.
OUT_PKT is the number of the output packets of the system.
DMA_PKT is the number of packets that matches MSPM.
NO_CHECK_PKT_CNT is the number of packets that are evaluated by MSPM but do not generate matches.

In simulation, the PCIe are bypassed. Any packets that have MSPM matches (i.e. trigger full match) will be dropped. 
Thus, in above example, the OUT_PKT is 90, DMA_PKT is 10, and NO_CHECK_PKT_CNT is 90.
